## what is meant by

when poems are born from the sways of southern winds.

```bash
"dakhina batashe utala mon"
```

## from where it arose.

```python
southern winds

# returns 'premahawa'
dakkhinayon.dola('premahawa')

# returns 'kobita bhabna'
dakkhinayon.bhabna('kobita bhabna')

# returns 'sfuron'
dakkhinayon.ahlad('sfuron')
```

## legendary level

reached few folks.

ensuring the true essence of my poems rather than perverting romance.
